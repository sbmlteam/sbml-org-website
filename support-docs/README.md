Support documentation
=====================

This directory contains materials relevant to people who maintain the SBML.org website.  It explains how to run the server, how to update site pages, and more, and contains some custom materials such as graphics and logo artwork.

If you are working on the site, or want to change text or other content, here is roughly how you can proceed:

1. Start by reading the information in [site-organization](./site-organization), which summarizes how the size is organized.

2. Next, consult the file [how-to-run-development-server](./how-tos/how-the-development-site-works.md) for an explanation of how to run a local development server so that you can preview the site on your personal computer and see the changes updated live as you make edits.

3. Then, consult the rest of the explanations in the [how-tos](./how-tos) directory to learn how to do things such as how to request changes to the life site.
